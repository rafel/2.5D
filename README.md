This  little tech-demo is an exploration in multiple 2D layers on different depth, also called <strong>2.5D</strong>. To get the sense of the depth of the images the demo uses head-tracking via PrimeSense so that the user can change the view to “look behind” the layers.<br />The demo also has some 2D effects such as light and blur.
<br /><br />This project was programmed by Sam Sam, Rafel Ridha and Atie Daghlawi. Both Sam and Rafel programmed everything in the application except the head tracking algorithm, which was programmed by Atie.
